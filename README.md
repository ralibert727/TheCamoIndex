# TheCamoIndex
Web app made using React with the Ionic Framework. Get random images of military/commercial camouflage patterns with five different environment/biome categories. It also has a location plugin that will give the user their current coordinates (Fits with the military theme I was going with). This repository is mainly for the code used to create it.
